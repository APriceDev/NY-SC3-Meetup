### About & History
- author: James McCartney
- SuperCollider is a state of the art, realtime sound synthesis server as well as an interpreted Object Oriented language which is based on Smalltalk but with C language family syntax. The language functions as a network client to the sound synthesis server.
- ICMC 1996 paper: http://www.audiosynth.com/icmc96paper.html
- SuperCollider is free software published under the GNU GPL

### !!! SAFETY !!!
- when SC blows - it has NO RESPECT for your volume control settings
- working with closed headphones - No-No
- if you absolutely have to - keep the headphones shifted from your ears when you execute code, and only move them over ears when code is running already

### Application examples / inspiration-copy-paste sources
- examples folder in supercollider.app
- steal this sound - http://new-supercollider-mailing-lists-forums-use-these.2681727.n2.nabble.com/Steal-this-sound-td7584330.html
- supercollider tweets [SC140](http://sctweets.tumblr.com/) are great to explore the syntax-pushing boundaries
