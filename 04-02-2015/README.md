### About & History
- SuperCollider 3 is a state of the art, realtime sound synthesis server as well as an interpreted Object Oriented language which is based on Smalltalk but with C language family syntax. The language functions as a network client to the sound synthesis server.
- SuperCollider 1 was developed by James McCartney in 1996. Here is the original ICMC paper: http://www.audiosynth.com/icmc96paper.html
- Since joining Apple's Core Audio development team, James published SuperCollider source code under the GNU GPL license making it free open source software. 

### !!! SAFETY !!!
- when SC blows - it has NO RESPECT for your volume control settings
- working with closed headphones - No-No
- if you absolutely have to - keep the headphones shifted from your ears when you execute code, and only move them over ears when code is running already

### Application examples
